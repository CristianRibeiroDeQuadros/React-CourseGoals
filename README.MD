Hello world.

This is a very simple project that simulates a list of goals relating to a ficticious course that we might be studying which we can create using the input field labeled as "Course Goal".

After filling out the course goal field, click on the "Add Goal" button.

The new value captured in the input text will be pushed into an array that already contains 3 items.

New features are coming. Thanks for visiting my project.

May the code be with you!
